# Closures, Iterators & Generators

## Closures

A Closure is a function object that remembers values in enclosing scopes regardless of whether those scopes are still present in memory. If you have written a function that returned another function, you probably have used closures without even knowing.

**Example:**

```python
def generate_power_func(n):
    def nth_powah(x):
        return x**n
    return nth_powah


x = generate_power_func(10)
print x
# What happens? How is this possible?
```

```python
def generate_power_func(n):
    def nth_powah(x):
        return x**n
    return nth_powah


x = generate_power_func(10)
print x

y = x(4)
print y

# What happens now?
```

### Why Use Closures?

* Closures can avoid the use of global values and provide some form of data hiding. 
* They provide a layer of simplicity

### Why to Avoid Closures?

* They are harder to debug
* They may not always be cleaner
* They can get complex quickly

## Iterators

An iterator is just an object with a state that remembers where it is during iteration. Iterable objects can range from while loops to the actual iter object.

**Example of iter function:**

```python
>>> x = iter([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
>>> print x
<listiterator object at 0x02B2AB30>
x.next()
1
x.next()
2
x.next()
3
x.next()
4
x.next()
5
x.next()
6
x.next()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
StopIteration
```

The one we will be using the most is the xrange\(\) function. Below is an iterator, implemented as a class that works like xrange. This is your first major look at classes... don't freak out! Let's break this down.

```python
class yrange:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.i = 0
        self.n = n

    def __iter__(self):
        return self

    def next(self):
        if self.i < self.n:
            i = self.i
            self.i += 1
            return i
        else:
            raise StopIteration()

# using y range
yrange(3)
y.next()
0
y.next()
1
y.next()
2
y.next()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "<stdin>", line 14, in next
StopIteration
```

As we learned in the Data Types lecture... xrange\(\) loads one at a time. The yrange\(\) class here does the same thing. There are lists, tuples, etc... loaded up. Instead, we deal with two variables: i and n.

## Generators

Generators are also iterators \(iterators are not always generators though\). Generators simplify the creation of iterators. A generator is simply a function that produces a sequence of values to iterate through rather than a single value.

```python
def yrange(n):
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        yield i
        i += 1
my_gen = yrange(10)
print my_gen
for i in my_gen:
    print(i)

# output
<generator object yrange at 0x007F3328>
0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
```

Taking a look at the code above... we created a sequence object and iterated over it using a for loop.

**Note:** When functions return all state is lost, a yield preserves local state and returns a generator object.
