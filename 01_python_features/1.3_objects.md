# Objects

Python has no unboxed or primitive types, no machine values. Instead, **everything in Python is an Object!** Objects involve an abstract way of thinking about programming. Down to the core, an object is just a struct; an encapsulation of variables and functions into a single entity. But on the surface, objects provide inheritance and other powerful uses.

* **Inheritance** simply means an object can be assigned to a variable or passed into a function for example. 
* Unlike C, where an integer \(for example\) is a machine primitive… a single unstructured chunk of memory… a Python integer will be an object, a large block of structured memory, where different parts of that structure are used internally to the interpreter. **Why does this matter?** Thanks to everything being an object, our types have more features. Meaning... we can do more things to them. This also means they are larger than the machine primitve types we are used to.
