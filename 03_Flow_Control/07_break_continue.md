# Break and Continue

## Looking at previous languages

The concept is exactly the same as it was in C/C++. If further examples are needed of how Break/Continue works, reference C/C++ material or PyDocs.

### Break

The break statement simply breaks out of the innermost enclosing loop.

```python
for i in xrange(1, 101):
    if i == 10:
        print "NEOW MORE LIVES!"
        break
    print i
```

**Output:**

```text
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
NEOW MORE LIVES!
```

### Continue

The continue statement continues with the next iteration of the loop.

```python
for i in xrange(1, 100):​
    if i % 2 == 0:​
        print "{} is an even number!".format(i)​
        continue #prevents second print from running​
    print "{} is an odd number!".format(i) ​
```

**Output:**

```text
1 is an odd number!
2 is an even number!
3 is an odd number!
4 is an even number!
5 is an odd number!
6 is an even number!
7 is an odd number!
8 is an even number!
9 is an odd number!
10 is an even number!
11 is an odd number!
12 is an even number!
13 is an odd number!
14 is an even number!
15 is an odd number!
16 is an even number!
17 is an odd number!
18 is an even number!
19 is an odd number!
20 is an even number!
....
```

Notice how the second print is skipped entirely for even numbers!
