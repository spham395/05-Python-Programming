# Strings

#### Reference: [Strings](https://docs.python.org/2.7/tutorial/introduction.html#strings)

## What is a sequence object?

A sequence object is a container of items accessed via index. Text strings are technically sequence objects.

### Sequence Object Types:

* String
* Lists
* Tuples
* Range Objects

_Each of the above support built in functions and slicing._

## Sequence Objects: Strings

**Strings are immutable!** They need to be reassigned. There are two independent types of strings:

* **ASCII:** Default strings for Python 2
* **Unicode \(UTF-8\):** Default strings for Python 3

To declare a string, use one of the following. There is no Pythonic way aside from keeping it as simple and clean as possible.

* 'single quotes'
* "double quotes"
* "\"escaped\" quotes"
* """triple quoted-multiline"""
* r"\"raw\" strings"

### String Prefixes

* u or U for Unicode​
* r or R for raw string literal \(ignores escape characters\)​
* b or B for byte… is ignored in Python 2 since str is bytes.​
* A ‘u’ or ‘b’ prefix may be followed by a ‘r’ prefix.​

Yes, this stuff is old school and not very Pythonic... but it can't be helped.

### Difference between ASCII and Unicode \(utf-8\)

**ASCII** defines 128 characters, mapped 0-127. **Unicode** on the other hand defines less than 2^21 characters, mapped 0-2^21. It is worth noting that not all Unicode numbers are assigned yet. Unicode numbers 0-128 have the same meaning as ASCII values; but do not fit into one 8-bit block of memory like ASCII values do. Thus Unicode in Python 3 utilizes **utf-8** which allows for the use of multiple 8-bit blocks of memory.

### Byte String vs Data String

Byte Strings are simply just a sequence of bytes. In Python 2, **bytes** is an alias of str. In other words, they are used interchangeably. In Python 3 on the other hand, str is it's own type... utilizing Unicode \(utf-8\). Whereas the _bytes_ type in Python 3 is still a bytes object in ASCII; an array of integers.

​

**Python 2**

```python
>>> x = "I am a string"
>>> type(x)
<type 'str'>​

>>> x​
'I am a string'

>>> hex(ord(x[0]))​
0x49​
```

**Python 3**

```python
>>> x = 'I am a string'.encode('ASCII')​
>>> type(x)​
<class 'bytes'>​

>>> print(hex(x[0]))​
0x49 # ASCII code for capital I​
```

```python
>>> x = b'I am a string' # Doing this in Python 2 makes no difference
>>> type(x)
<class 'bytes'>
```

### Unicode Strings

**Python 2**

```python
>>> x = u"I am a unicode string"
>>> type(x)​
<type 'unicode'>​

>>> y = unicode("Look at me! I’m a unicode string.")​
>>> type(y)​
<type 'unicode'>​

# You can use ‘…’ quotes “…” quotes or “””…””” quotes​
```

**Python 3**

```python
>>> x = 'I am a unicode string'
>>> type(x)​
<class 'str'>​
​
# class str is unicode in Python 3 natively​
# You can use ‘…’ quotes “…” quotes or “””…””” quotes​
```

### Slicing

Slicing allows you to grab a substring of a string. Just like C/C++, Python's indexing structure starts at 0. The only exception is when grabbing an element using a negative index. There is an example further below.

**Grabbing a specific element**

```python
>>> x = "hello world"​
>>> print x[4] # grabs 4th index
o
```

**Grab a range of elements**

```python
>>> x = "hello world"
>>> print x[4:9] # grabs 4th index up until, but not including the 9th index. 
o wor
```

**Grabbing backwards from the last element**

```python
>>> x = "hello world"
>>> print x[-3] # grabs the 3rd to the last ELEMENT
r
```

* Slicing with negative values start at -1, not 0​. So if we have a string \(x = "test"... t= -4, e = -3 s = -2 t = -1\)... Thus a -2 slice will grab the 's'.
* When slicing a range, you grab everything UPTO \(not including\) the second defined number.

### More String Manipulation

* Try the following in your PyInter

```python
>>> my_string = "Hello World!"
>>> print my_string[0]​
H​
>>> print my_string[0:5]​
Hello​
>>> print my_string[6:]​
World!​

>>> print my_string[-6:] # ???​
>>> print my_string[::2] # ???​
>>> print my_string  * 2 # ???​
>>> print my_string + my_string # ???​
```

What did you get? Try different operations to manipulate strings!

### String Special Operators

| Operator | Description |
| :---: | :---: |
| + | Concatenation |
| \* | Repetition |
| \[\] | Slice |
| \[:\] | Range Slice |
| in | Membership - returns true if a character exists |
| not in | Membership - returns true if a character does not exist |
| % | Format |

### User Input

There are a few ways to capture user input in Python. The most common are **raw\_input\(\)** in Python 2 and **input\(\)** in Python 3. It is important that you use raw\_input\(\) in Python 2... as input\(\) has security vulnerabilities. In Python 3, input\(\) takes user input as a string, no matter the input. On the other hand, input\(\) in Python 2 will take user input as the type presented. This can lead to users implementing false bools and such.

**Python 2**

```python
>>> name = raw_input("What is your name? ")
What is your name? <user input>
>>> name
<user input>
```

**Python 3**

```python
>>> name = input("What is your name? ")
What is your name? <user input>
>>> name
<user input>
```

As you more than likely guessed, the user input is assigned to the variable _name_ and stored as a string. From here, you can treat var name as any other regular string.

### Useful String Methods

* **string.upper\(\)** \# Outputs string as uppercase​
* **string.lower\(\)** \# Outputs string as lowercase​
* **len\(string\)** \# Outputs string length​
* **symbol.join\(string/list\)** \# Most commonly used to join list items, outputs string.​
* **string.split\(symbol \)**\# Most commonly used to split a string up into a list of items, outputs list.​

```python
>>> my_string = "Hello World!”"
>>> a = my_string.upper()​
>>> print a​
'HELLO WORLD!'​
>>> a = my_string.lower()​
>>> print a ​
'hello world!'​
>>> a = len(my_string)​
>>> print a​
12​
>>> a = my_string.split(" ")​
['Hello', 'World!']​
>>> print my_string​
'Hello World!'​
>>> my_string = "+".join(a)​
>>> print my_string​
'Hello+World!'
```

### Changing a Character

```python
>>> my_string = "Hello World!"​
>>> my_string[1]​
'e'
>>> my_string[1] = 'E'
```

What's the outcome? How does **replace\(\)** work?

### Join

**join\(\)** combines sequential string elements by a specified \_str \_separator. If no separator is specified join will insert white space by default.

Syntax:

```python
str.join(sequence)
```

Example:

```python
s = "-";
seq = ("a", "b", "c"); # This is sequence of strings.
print s.join( seq )

#Output: a-b-c
```

### Split

**split\(\)** will breakup a string and add the data to a string array using a defined separator.

Syntax:

```python
str.split(str="", num=string.count(str))

#str - any delimeter, by default it is space.
#num - number of lines minus one.
```

Example:

```python
x = ‘blue,red,green’
x.split(“,”)

[‘blue’, ‘red’, ‘green’]
>>>

>>> a,b,c = x.split(“,”)

>>> a
‘blue’

>>> b 
‘red’

>>> c
‘green’
```

### Additional Standard Library Functionality

* find, rfind​
